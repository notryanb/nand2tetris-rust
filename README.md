Nand2Tetris-Rust
---

This project is an attempt to work through the exercises found in the book, 
[The Elements of Computing Systems - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
While the website includes an HDL program and other goodies,
I thought it might be interesting to see how this might work out in code as I work through the real HDL and rust library simultaneously.
